## History

During the early days of the computer industry, computer security was largely ignored in favor of cost and speed as companies fought to survive.
As computing technology advanced, computers became more ubiquitous and the computing industry began to thrive.
With the advent of the internet, computer systems could be infiltrated more easily, quickly, and from across the globe.

Computer security therefore started to be focused on much more.
This was influenced by the spread of massive security exploits in the early 2000s.
In 2003, the Sapphire/Slammer worms spread to almost 75,000 hosts in less than 15 minutes.
Afterwards, researchers found that with a properly designed worm, called a flash worm, more than [a million machines could be infiltrated in under a second](https://www.icir.org/vern/papers/topspeed-worm04.pdf).

Recently, the introduction of cryptocurrencies has boosted the cyber-crime industry by enabling malicious actors to more easily and covertly extort victims.

## Overview

<blockquote>
Computer security, cybersecurity, digital security or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from attacks by malicious actors that may result in unauthorized information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

There are four basic components to security:

- Confidentially: refers to concealing information and resources so that they are only accessed by the proper users.
- Authenticity: refers to identifying and validating the sources of information.
- Integrity: refers to how trustworthy resources and data are with respect to modification by only proper, authorized sources.
- Availability: refers to the ability of users to access resources and information.

**Vulnerabilities** or **threats** refer to security flaws in computer systemsâ€”they are potential violations of security.
On the other hand, **exploits** refer to actual attacks that take advantage of vulnerabilities to violate security with the intent to do so.

### Attacks

Each component of security can be attacked.

**Eavesdropping** is an example of a confidentially attack.
In this kind of attack, an unauthorized actor access information they were not intended to.

**Tampering**, where an unauthorized actor modified information in some way between the sender and the receiver, is an example of an integrity attack.

**Fabrication** is an example of an attack against authenticity in which an authorized actor assumes the identity of an authorized source to falsely create and disseminate information.
